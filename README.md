# Spam Classifier (Introduction)
In this project we have created and implemented a spam classifier model on a dataset taken from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection. 
The data consists of messages and label to identify whether it is a ham or spam. Here we performed data cleaning and preprocessing, followed by Stemming
and Bag of Words technique and finally developed a Naive Bayes Multinomial model which gave a good accuracy of more than 95%.
